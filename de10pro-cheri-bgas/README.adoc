The https://github.com/CTSRD-CHERI/DE10Pro-cheri-bgas[DE10Pro-cheri-bgas]
repository to provides FPGA bitfiles for the CHERI-BGAS project.

It includes the Stratix 10 Quartus project, IP configuration, toplevel entity
verilog, and signal tap configuration files, necessary for synthesis of a
configuration image for the Terasic DE10Pro SX board.
At the moment, the project uses Quartus 23.2pro.

This repository also includes RTL sources under the
https://github.com/CTSRD-CHERI/DE10Pro-cheri-bgas/tree/main/bluespec[bluespec/]
folder, where various git submodules are used and suplemented with a few `.bsv`
files providing some "toplevel glue" as well as a minimal simulation
framework.

=== Build a Stratix 10 bitfile

Building the `vipbundle` tool requires a working installation of the `ghc`
haskell compiler with the `regex-tdfa` haskell library. It will be built
automatically as part of the overall build process for the FPGA image.

Additionally, you will need a working installation of
https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/programmable/downloads/download-center.html[Quartus 23.2pro]
and a https://github.com/B-Lang-org/bsc[bluespec compiler].

You can then run:

[source, shell]
----
$ make synthesize
----

to generate a `output_files/DE10Pro-cheri-bgas.sof` Stratix 10 FPGA bitfile.

==== Generate `.rbf` bitfile slices and embed a bootloader

The bitfiles generated embed both a soft RISCV core and an ARM Hard Processor
System (HPS). The bootloader code for the HPS can be embedded into a bitfile.
To do so, you can run

[source, shell]
----
$ BOOTLOADER=some/bootloader/ihex make gen-rbf
----
or simply
[source, shell]
----
$ make gen-rbf
----

once an FPGA bitfile has been successfully generated.
This will generate two `.rbf` slices out of the `.sof`, one for the base
`hps` system configuration, and one  `core` configuration.
The `BOOTLOADER` environment variable defaults to
`$(CURDIR)/software/uboot_build/u-boot-socfpga/spl/u-boot-spl-dtb.ihex`.

== Intel Stratix 10 Hard Processor System interactions

Software running on the HPS can interact with the RISCV system on the FPGA in a
variety of ways.  The HPS can use a "lightweight" 32-bit AXI4 port as well as a
128-bit AXI4 port to perform FPGA accesses.
https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/programmable/hps/stratix-10/hps.html[As
documented by Intel], several windows in the HPS's address space can be used to
perform these accesses:

- https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/programmable/hps/stratix-10/index.html#ukm1505401875982.html[FPGA_bridge_lwsoc2fpga_2M]:
  `0xf900_0000 -> 0xf91f_ffff`

  `0x20_4000_0000 -> 0x20_5fff_ffff`

  `0x20_6000_0000 -> 0x20_ffff_ffff`

Additionally, the RISCV system is provided a window into the HPS system's memory
map via adedicated 128-bit fpga2hps AXI4 slave port.

=== lwsoc2fpga "lightweight" AXI4 master port

The 32-bit lwsoc2fpga "lightweight" AXI4 master port is used for accesses in the
`0xf900_0000` to `0xf91f_ffff` range. Exposed through these addresses on the
FPGA side in the RISCV system are the following:

- `0xf900_0000 -> 0xf900_0fff`: Debug Unit
- `0xf900_1000 -> 0xf900_1fff`: Interrupt lines
- `0xf900_2000 -> 0xf900_2fff`: Others (not yet clear what exactly...)
- `0xf900_3000 -> 0xf900_3fff`: "fake" 16550
- `0xf900_4000 -> 0xf900_4fff`: h2f address controller

=== soc2fpga AXI4 master port

The 128-bit soc2fpga AXI4 master port is used for accesses in the ranges
documented above. It is a 32-bit address port which exposes a 4GB wide window
into the same 64-bit address memory map perceived by the RISCV core on the
FPGA. The device exposed via the lwsoc2fpga port at `0xf900_4000 ->
0xf900_4fff` allows software on the FPGA to specify the upper 32 bits of a full
64-bit address and effectively slide the available 4GB window.

=== fpga2hps AXI4 slave port

The 128-bit fpga2hps AXI4 slave port provides the RISCV softcore system with
cache-coherent access to the HPS memory map. See the
https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/programmable/us/en/pdfs/literature/hb/stratix-10/s10_5v4.pdf[Intel Stratix 10 Hard Processor System Technical Reference Manual]

== Simulation framework

A minimal simulation framework is provided under the
https://github.com/CTSRD-CHERI/DE10Pro-cheri-bgas/tree/main/bluespec[bluespec/]
directory. See
